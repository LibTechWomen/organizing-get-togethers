## Why
Lib* conferences, for many, are the only time where they can meet others outside of their workplace or work region, given the limited amount of budgets that many have for professional development and travel. Many folks might have heard about #libtechwomen online or colleagues, but many have not. #libtechwomen get-togethers provide an opportunity to introduce these folks to the #libtechwomen community. 

For folks who are already in the #libtechwomen community, these get-togethers provide the opportunity to connect a face to a name. Many of these meet-ups serve as the first time people meet others face-to-face after corresponding online for a time. Having that personal connection strengthens not only that personal bond, but the bond of the community as a whole.

Of course, two other reasons why you should organize a #libtechwomen get-together is to spread the word and to start a discussion about supporting women and other underrepresented populations in libtech, and in the technology community at large. In my experience, some folks are not aware of some of the challenges faced by some in the community, and have become involved in #libtechwomen as a result of the get-together.

## When
Conferences are already jammed packed. When are you going to meet?! You have several options, depending on your situation.

One of the key spots to look at for scheduling a get-together is a meal outside of the conference schedule. Traditionally get-togethers have been done in the evening hours for dinner and drinks as a way to reach folks who otherwise have no other plans after the last session ends for that day. Lunch is another possibility, but you will need to be mindful of the time allotted for lunch, as well as any business or other group meetings that will be going on during the conference day. Breakfast hasn't been done before (as far as I know), though is still a possibility. 

You've probably noticed that the first three options are related to food. Food typically brings people together, and everyone has to eat at a conference sometime! You can organize a non-food related event; however, food tends to be a draw to events, even when people pay their own way.

In any case, you are looking at a block of time for folks to introduce themselves and have non-rushed conversations and possibly a large group discussion. Previous get-togethers have tended to last between 1.5 to 2 hours, depending on the company, location, and scheduling.

As for when in the overall conference schedule you should schedule the get-together, you will need to be mindful about all-conference events. If there is an all-conference dinner or lunch, avoid scheduling the get-together opposite that event. Try not to schedule the nights before and after a conference ends since people will be traveling to and from the conference. Some conferences have events going on at all times of the day; your best bet is to find a slot that will have the least amount of conflict with another event - for example, schedule a get-together happy hour before a conference party later in the evening.

## Where
Getting a space for up to 20 or 30 people can be tricky. You can look at various places to meet near the conference venue; however, be aware that many places will have either a room charge or a minimum purchase for booking a large private room. In these cases, you can split your group reservations up into smaller groups for restaurants. While this means that people might not get the chance to chat with the other groups, smaller groups are easier to deal with in terms of discussion and meeting other folks and remembering their names the day after. ;c)

The conference venue itself might have a space for the get-together; in that case, you will need to contact the conference organizers about the availability of and the rules for using conference rooms for the get-together. Note that many conferences forbid groups from bringing in catering/food from external sources. Conference rooms might be best if you don't plan to have food at the get-together or if you can manage an agreement with the hotel restaurant to take food orders from the room.

## How
### Timeline
Once you know that you are going to a conference and you are interested in doing a get-together, find others that are going to the same conference to see if they would be interested in helping with planning the event: email the #libtechwomen Google Group, tweet out with the conference and #libtechwomen hashtags, or reach out to #libtechwomen friends that you know who are going to the same conference. Ideally, this should be done as soon as you register or are 100% sure you are going to the conference.
